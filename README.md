# Project Title: Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains three key machine learning tasks focusing on self learning and improvement. The tasks are organized as separate scripts and Jupyter notebooks for easy reference.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: MOVIE GENRE  CLASSIFICATION
- **Description**:
     Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
       movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
          can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
            such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

- **Goal**: The goal of this task is to predict the genre of a  movie based on its plot summary .
  
### Task 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
- **Description**: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
                     dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
                       experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

- **Goal**: The goal of this task is to  detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions.



### Task 3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
- **Description**: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
                   features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try  algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to                          predict churn.
- **Goal**: The goal of this task is to to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business
